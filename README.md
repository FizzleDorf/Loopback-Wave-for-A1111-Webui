# Loopback-Wave-for-A1111-Webui
Img2img Loopback with Denoise controls over designated frames.

*Disclaimer: I am not the original author of this script. This was originally by an anonymous user on 4chan I came across during my early months exploring animations in SD. There is no "official" repo, only the rentry page linked in this README*

Original rentry by anon where you can find the original script: https://rentry.org/sd-loopback-wave

My rentry guide explaining how it works: https://rentry.org/AnimAnon-LoopbackWave

Installation:
Place the script into the A1111 webui Scripts folder. The script will become a selection in the script dropdown. This only works in the img2img tab and also requires an input image to use. Explainations of the settings are in the two links provided above.


I hope you have fun with it! Feel free to fork and edit the code but I will not be accepting PRs unless there is something completely broken that needs to be fixed.
